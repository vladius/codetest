## Bowling Scoring Rules

[Ten-Pin bowling on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling)

Every frame the player makes at least one roll.

If they knock down 10 pins they have a strike (marked with an X) and don't roll anymore in this frame, otherwise they roll once more. If that second roll knocks down the remaining pins, then they have a spare (marked with a /).

The score of a frame is the sum of their rolls. If they rolled a strike, the next 2 rolls are added to their score(whether they are 2 in the next frame, or in the case of 3 strikes in a row, the next 2 frames). In the case of a spare
they add the next roll to their score.

The final frame has some special handling. If they player rolls a strike, they roll twice more (but those don't have any special strike handling, they're just added to the total). If the player rolls a spare, they roll once more.

A perfect game (all strikes, and knocking down 10 pins in all rolls on the last frame) is 300 points.
